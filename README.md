# reactivex-go-programming
This repository is created to support [this](https://prakharsrivastav.com/posts/reactive-programming-in-go/) blog post. The repository is still a work in progress and I will add
more examples to it. The examples so far are ready to execute and run.

## installing reactive go extension for GO 
`go get -u github.com/reactivex/rxgo/v2`

## Running examples.

you can run all the examples from the root of the project directory like below:
```shell script
go run a_simple/main.go 

go run b_callbacks/main.go 

go run c_hot_vs_cold/main.go

go run d_datamigration/main.go
```
